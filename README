DSTwitt is a Twitter client for the Nintendo DS Browser.

Features

- Battle tested
- Fast & Responsive UI (at least more than m.twitter.com)
- Use up-to-date API (at this time of writing)
  - OAuth
  - RT API
- Use image to work-around the lack of Thai support.
  (of course you still can't tweet in Thai)
- Support both SSR & Desktop mode.
  (I suggests users to use Desktop mode. To switch to SSR text-only 
  mode, switch the browser to SSR mode first then select the last link 
  in the menu.)
